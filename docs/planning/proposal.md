# Final project proposal

- [ ] I have reviewed the project guidelines.
- [ ] I will be working alone on this project.
- [ ] No significant portion of this project will be (or has been) used in other course work.

## Embedded System Description

At a high level, explain in 2-3 sentences what your embedded system will do.  Then, in 1-2 sentences each, explain each input, the process, and each output. This section is the bulk of the proposal.

## Hardware Setup

What hardware will you require? Provide a conceptual circuit diagram and/or block diagram to help the reviewers understand your proposal. Be sure to introduce and discuss your figures in the text.

## Software overview

Discuss, at a high level, a concept of how your code will work. Include a *high-level* flowchart. This is a high-level concept that should concisely communicate the project's concept.

## Testing Procedure

Briefly describe how you will test and verify that your project is a success. Think about how you will *demo* the final project. If you need extra equipment for the demo, be sure that you can either bring the equipment or convincingly simulate it. For example, if you want to build a system that uses CAN bus to interface with your car, you won't be able to bring your car into Cobleigh for the demo...


## Prescaler

Desired Prescaler level: 

- [ ] 100%
- [ ] 95% 
- [ ] 90% 
- [ ] 85% 
- [ ] 80% 
- [ ] 75%
